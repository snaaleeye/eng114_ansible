## What is IaC?

Infrastructure as code is the process of managing and provisioning computer data centers through machine-readable definition files, rather than physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools.

or in simple terms

Infrastructure as code (IaC) means to manage your IT infrastructure using configuration files.

## Why should we use Iac? Benefits?

- Cost reduction
- Scalability and availability
- Monitoring and performance visibility
- Consistency 

## What tools are available

- Chef
- Puppet
- Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform
- Saltstack
- Terraform 
- AWS CloudFormation

## What is configuration management and orchestration under IaC

 Configuration Management

Config Management is part of provisioning. Basically, that’s using a tool like Chef, Puppet or Ansible to configure our server. “Provisioning” often implies it’s the first time we do it. Config management usually happens repeatedly.

Configuration management (CM) is a systems engineering process for establishing and maintaining consistency of a product’s performance, functional, and physical attributes with its requirements, design, and operational information throughout its life Configuration management is all about bringing consistency in the infrastructure.

- Orchestration

 Orchestration means arranging or coordinating multiple systems. It’s also used to mean “running the same tasks on a bunch of servers at once, but not necessarily all of them.”

- Configuration Orchestration vs Configuration Management

The first thing that should be clarified is the difference between “configuration orchestration” and “configuration management” tools, both of which are considered IaC tools and are included on this list.

Configuration orchestration tools, which include Terraform and AWS CloudFormation, are designed to automate the deployment of servers and other infrastructure. Configuration management tools like Chef, Puppet, and the others on this list help configure the software and systems on this infrastructure that has already been provisioned.

## What is Ansible?

Ansible is an IT automation tool. It can configure systems, deploy software, and orchestrate more advanced IT tasks such as continuous deployments or zero downtime rolling updates. Ansible’s goals are foremost those of simplicity and maximum ease of use.
